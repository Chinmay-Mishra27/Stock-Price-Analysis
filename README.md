Stock Price Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes historical stock price data to gain insights into stock performance. The analysis includes calculating daily returns, moving averages, and volatility, along with visualizations that provide a clear view of trends in stock prices over time. The project leverages Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to clean, process, and visualize the data.

Key Features:
Data Loading & Preprocessing:
Loads stock price data from a CSV file.
Handles missing or inconsistent data and formats the date column.
Analysis:
Calculates daily returns and volatility.
Computes Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for 7-day and 30-day periods.
Visualization:
Line plots for stock price trends.
Moving averages plotted alongside the stock price.
